Enhanced Code Scanner for ECC6.0

The default code scanner in ECC only scans reports, functions, and classes.  
This implicit enhancement will add to that scan enhancements via the enhancement
framework (implicit as well as Enahcement Spots & Enhancement Sections), Web Dynpro
components, BSP Applications (the ABAP within them, not the HTML), and the ABAP Code embedded
within Adobe Forms & Smartforms.
